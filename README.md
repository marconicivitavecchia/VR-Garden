# VR-Garden
3D model of the inner garden to meet in virtual reality.

The garden was made on the occasion of the [first VR festival](https://marconicivitavecchia.github.io/2022-vrfestival-website/) of IIS Marconi Civitavecchia, Italy ([here](https://marconicivitavecchia.github.io/2022-vrfestival-website/vr-garden.html) the direct link to the project page). The garden is realized using Blender and Unity and uploaded to VRChat for social interaction.

A video showing the VR garden and real garden is available [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CsIfhmmubFGT0FT8MzE9i3NcL0ogaM3_/view?usp=sharing).

This project is also currently used in the project "[The School of Athens VR](https://the-school-of-athens-vr.com/)", also a work in progress of our school.
